\tightparagraph{Experiment Setup} We fine-tune GPT-3.5 Turbo using supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback~\citep{ouyang2022training,openai2023gpt4} on the aforementioned data, as well as data for model capabilities. The baseline is a similarly fine-tuned model but only trained with data for model capabilities and not our instruction hierarchy examples. For both models, we use the best performing checkpoint according to validation accuracy and evaluate across different safety and capability benchmarks. Both models achieved \textit{comparable metrics on capabilities evaluations} (e.g., TriviaQA, LAMBADA, HellaSwag), showing that the instruction hierarchy does not degrade generic capabilities.

\tightparagraph{Evaluation} We create an evaluation suite using open-source and novel datasets. This includes both in-domain attacks, attacks that are aimed to test generalization, and ``over-refusal'' evaluations that test our models ability to follow benign instructions. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:evaluation} for full details. For each evaluation, we report error bars of one standard deviation above/below the mean. All metrics are framed such that a higher value is better.

\tightparagraph{Main Results} The instruction hierarchy improves safety results on all of our main evaluations (Figure~\ref{fig:main_results}), even increasing robustness by up to 63\%. We show qualitative examples of our model's behavior versus the baseline's for three of these evaluations in Table~\ref{tab:qualitative_success}.

\tightparagraph{Generalization Results} The instruction hierarchy also exhibits generalization to each of the evaluation criteria that we explicitly excluded from training (Figure~\ref{fig:generalization}), even increasing robustness by up to 34\%. This includes jailbreaks for triggering unsafe model outputs, attacks that try to extract passwords from the system message, and prompt injections via tool use. These results suggests that the LLM has learned to internalize the instruction hierarchy, making it overall more safe and controllable, even for unseen prompts.

\tightparagraph{Over-refusal Results} A key risk is that our models learn to \textit{never} follow lower-priority instructions; in reality, we only want models to ignore lower-priority instructions when they conflict with higher-priority ones. For the over-refusal evaluations, which consist of benign instructions and boundary cases (i.e. prompts that look like attacks but are in fact safe to comply with), our goal is to match the baseline performance. Figure~\ref{fig:overrefusal} shows these results, where our models follow non-conflicting instructions almost as well as the baseline on most evaluations. We observe regressions on two tasks, System Message Probing Questions and Jailbreakchat with Allowed Prompts. Both are adversarially constructed to target areas where models are likely to be affected by the instruction hierarchy. For example, Jailbreakchat with Allowed Prompts consists of benign user inputs that look like jailbreaks. Nevertheless, on typical real-world usages, we do not expect the instruction hierarchy to cause noticeable degradations in model behavior. %\lilian{<--- not sure whether we have time but the best way to show the model will be fine with non-adversarial cases is to show with an eval on that traffic.} \kai{imo to get real-world usage evals, we'd need to measure something like DAU after shipping to mainline. I'm not sure if our static eval set (even if some of it involves prod data) covers it.} \johannes{DAU change in A/B test would be best, but unrealistic to get quickly, will have to wait at least 2 weeks} \johannes{We could mention the RM score: an internal eval that aims to predict user preferences between models does not find any signficiant difference between baseline and instruction hierarchy model (RM v6 eval - we might not want to go into any detail of how it works)}
