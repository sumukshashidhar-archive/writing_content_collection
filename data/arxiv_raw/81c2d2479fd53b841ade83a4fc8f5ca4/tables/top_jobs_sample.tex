\caption{Occupations with the highest exposure according to each measurement. The final row lists the occupations with the highest $\sigma^2$ value, indicating that they had the most variability in exposure scores. Exposure percentages indicate the share of an occupation's task that are exposed to GPTs ($\pmb{\alpha}$) or GPT-powered software ($\pmb{\beta}$ and $\pmb{\zeta}$), where exposure is defined as driving a reduction in time it takes to complete the task by at least 50\% (see exposure rubric \ref{exposure_tax}). As such, occupations listed in this table are those where we estimate that GPTs and GPT-powered software are able to save workers a significant amount of time completing a large share of their tasks, but it does not necessarily suggest that their tasks can be fully automated by these technologies. All tasks are assigned equal weight within an occupation.}
